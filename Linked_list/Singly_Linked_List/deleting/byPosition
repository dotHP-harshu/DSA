---- Here temp is a node that will be removed ----
1. Check if list is empty.
2. Assign head to a temporary node. [temp = head]
3. Check if position is one 
        -Update the head to the next node of temp .[head = temp->next ]
        -free the temp (deallocate the temp)
        -retun
4. Define another node that contain previous node of temp
5. Find the previous node and temp node using for loop
6. Check if temp is NULL then print error
7. Else connect previous and next node of temp . [previous->next = temp->next]
8. And free temp (deallocate).
