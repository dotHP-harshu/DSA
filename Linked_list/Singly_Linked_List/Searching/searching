1. Initialize position with 1. [int position =1]
2. Assign a temporary node to the head. [temp = head]
3. Start a while loop until the next of temp is NULL. And increase the position by one in every round.
4. Check if the data of temp is equal to the given value (key) then return the position 
5. Return -1 if node is not found.
